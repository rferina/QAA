seq len distribution should change after fastqc 

RNA seq data should have duplicated seq in data bc expression Levels
Overrepresented seq = adapter


grep seq with most common adapters

confirmed adapters by grepping for the seq in the original files. Had to use zgrep to grep in zipped files.

**22 R1:**

fastqc gave overrepresented sequences, called it __ adapter; larger in fastqc--tells me more than .1% total and matches illumina adapter
comes after adapter, illumina will tell us its gone

cutadapt on 22

ran trimmomatic, had to specify directories

accidentally wrote to paired file twice, had to rerun

6 Sept 2022

Ensembl.org → Downloads → FTP Downloads → Mouse → copied link address for DNA FASTA primary assembly and for GTF. Both are release 107.

Made dre directory for data, added the data on talapas /projects/bgmp/rferina/bioinfo/Bi622/QAA/dre.

wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-107/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-107/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf.gz

Made directory for STAR database: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.ens107.STAR2.7.10a

Tried to make database, forgot the input files have to be unzipped:
EXITING because of INPUT ERROR: the file format of the genomeFastaFile: /projects/bgmp/rferina/bioinfo/Bi622/QAA/dre/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz is not fasta: the first character is '' (31), not '>'.
 Solution: check formatting of the fasta file. Make sure the file is uncompressed (unzipped).

Unzipped them with gunzip and reran, made the database.

Aligned the paired read trimmomatic outputs to the mouse database.

!!!!! WARNING:  Could not ls 2_r1

EXITING: because of fatal INPUT file error: could not open read file: 2_r1
SOLUTION: check that this file exists and has read permision.

changed from 22_r1 to r1_22 for variable name and it worked!

Ran parse_sam.py to count the number of mapped and unmapped reads.

Tried to load htseq to see the documentation with -h; learned I had to specify htseq-count -h to see it. 

7 September 2022

Worked on distribution graphs, learned it doesn't like variables starting with numbers:
SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal

Had to use gzip.open to avoid this error:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b in position 1: invalid start byte

Had to decode lines by opening in 'rt' because of gzip.open
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'

Running htseq:
Format not recognized for output count file: txt
  [Exception type: ValueError, raised in utils.py:371]
Command exited with non-zero status 1

Htseq-count:
version 2.0.2.

count mapped/total
ICA4

unstranded twice as many reads??

trimmed prop divide by # records
2.7 showing what was trimemd from 2.5

wouldn't allow formatting or captioning for FastQc plots
![22r1_quality](22r1_per_base_quality.png)

cutadapt out file to see trimmed results

Notes from Leslie's mini lecture on strandedness:

normally only get
5'   geneA------geneC- 3' (+ strand)
3' -----geneB---geneD-5' (- strand)

genome FASTA and GTF file tells u which strand

convention only draw 5'

can't mix and match FASTA, has to match it
+ or - can change, so u must know and use correspodning GTF file

if unstranded prep and read alinged to Gene A and Gene B and in middle of C and D don;t know
if stranded, know gene C or D; if aligned to intron = unidentified gene or random transcription firing

was lib stranded or not?
we used htseq count to count which reads aligned to which features
-stranded as no, yes, reverse
(stranded no = same or opp strand of feature 50/50, on either strand if align with Gene A) (don't know what strand came from, have to count both as gene A)
(stranded yes = 1st read on same strand 2nd read on opp strand geneA
                                                                →  
                                                                       ←)
(stranded reverse = 1st on opp, 2nd on same as gene) geneA 
                                                        ←
                                                             
                                                     →        
                                                     
percetnages diff for rev and yes; 5% ; = not counting same genes every time; percent should be closer if the same

much higher count/perc diff = stranded
not stranded = same percentages for yes and reverse bc doesnt matter which, 50/50

if no they both count??

read counts table ; table generator

tried to add legend to graphs but it wouldn't clear

plt.clf()
plt.cla()
plt.close()

had to put graphs in separate scripts
