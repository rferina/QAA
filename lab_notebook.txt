Created QAA environment.
conda create --name QAA python=3.10
conda activate QAA

Installed all the programs needed for subsequent parts into QAA environment, checked that the versions were correct.
conda install cutadapt
cutadapt --version
4.1

conda install trimmomatic
trimmomatic -version
0.39

conda install star
conda install numpy
conda install pysam
conda install matplotlib
conda install htseq

Htseq-count:
version 2.0.2.

htseq: module load easybuild 
 You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "HTSeq/0.9.1-Python-3.6.1" module is available to load.

      easybuild  icc/2017.1.132-GCC-6.3.0-2.27  impi/2017.1.132
      easybuild  ifort/2017.1.132-GCC-6.3.0-2.27  impi/2017.1.132

      eb-hide/1  ifort/2017.1.132-GCC-6.3.0-2.27  impi/2017.1.132

Learned I don't load htseq-count this way--it should already be installed.

accidentally wrote to paired file twice, had to rerun trimmomatic.

6 Sept 2022

Ensembl.org → Downloads → FTP Downloads → Mouse → copied link address for DNA FASTA primary assembly and for GTF. Both are release 107.

Made dre directory for data, added the data on talapas /projects/bgmp/rferina/bioinfo/Bi622/QAA/dre.

wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-107/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-107/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf.gz

Made directory for STAR database: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.ens107.STAR2.7.10a

Tried to make database, forgot the input files have to be unzipped:
EXITING because of INPUT ERROR: the file format of the genomeFastaFile: /projects/bgmp/rferina/bioinfo/Bi622/QAA/dre/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz is not fasta: the first character is '' (31), not '>'.
 Solution: check formatting of the fasta file. Make sure the file is uncompressed (unzipped).

Unzipped them with gunzip and reran, made the database.

Aligned the paired read trimmomatic outputs to the mouse database.

!!!!! WARNING:  Could not ls 2_r1

EXITING: because of fatal INPUT file error: could not open read file: 2_r1
SOLUTION: check that this file exists and has read permision.

changed from 22_r1 to r1_22 for variable name and it worked!

Ran parse_sam.py to count the number of mapped and unmapped reads.

Tried to load htseq to see the documentation with -h; learned I had to specify htseq-count -h to see it. 

7 September 2022

Worked on distribution graphs, learned it doesn't like variables starting with numbers:
SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal

Had to use gzip.open to avoid this error:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b in position 1: invalid start byte

Had to decode lines by opening in 'rt' because of gzip.open
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'

Worked on pdf report in R. 
R wouldn't allow formatting or captioning for FastQc plots, had to change to knitr::include_graphics.
![22r1_quality](22r1_per_base_quality.png)

looked at cutadapt output file to see trimmed results.

Notes from Leslie's mini lecture on strandedness:
normally only get
5'   geneA------geneC- 3' (+ strand)
3' -----geneB---geneD-5' (- strand)

genome FASTA and GTF file tells u which strand

convention only draw 5'

can't mix and match FASTA, has to match it
+ or - can change, so u must know and use correspodning GTF file

if unstranded prep and read alinged to Gene A and Gene B and in middle of C and D don;t know
if stranded, know gene C or D; if aligned to intron = unidentified gene or random transcription firing

was lib stranded or not?
we used htseq count to count which reads aligned to which features
-stranded as no, yes, reverse
(stranded no = same or opp strand of feature 50/50, on either strand if align with Gene A) (don't know what strand came from, have to count both as gene A)
(stranded yes = 1st read on same strand 2nd read on opp strand geneA
                                                                →  
                                                                       ←)
(stranded reverse = 1st on opp, 2nd on same as gene) geneA 
                                                        ←
                                                             
                                                     →        
                                                     
percentages diff for rev and yes; 5% ; = not counting same genes every time; percent should be closer if the same

much higher count/perc diff = stranded
not stranded = same percentages for yes and reverse bc doesnt matter which, 50/50

if no they both count??


Worked on pdf report.

Tried to add legend to graphs but it wouldn't clear, even with
plt.clf()
plt.cla()
plt.close()

Had to put distribution graphs in separate scripts, ran out of time for argparse.
